\section{AutomatedSOS Alloy analysis}

    AutomatedSOS is a service developed on top of Data4Help that allows the monitoring of the Elderly people, and sends them an ambulance in case of sudden illness. Thus, it is very important that the service sends a request to the ambulance provider when the user's hearth frequency exceed a threshold. The following model has been built in order to guarantee this very critical constraint.
    
    \subsection{Signatures}
        
        Here we present all the signatures composing the model.

    \subsection{Facts}
 
        In this section, all the constraints needed in order to create a consistent model of the ambulance requests, are defined.

    \subsection{Asserts}
    
        At the end this two asserts verify if the model built respects all the constraints to guarantee the requirements explained before.
