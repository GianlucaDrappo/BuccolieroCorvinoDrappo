\section{Results}

    This section introduces all the results provide by Alloy through the predicates above.
  
\begin{lstlisting}[language=alloy]
    check singleRequest for 10
    check multipleRequest for 15 but exactly 8 User
    run show for 4 but exactly 4 User
\end{lstlisting}

    The two `check' allow the analysis of the assertion and the verification of them, then the `show' display the model and verify its consistency.
