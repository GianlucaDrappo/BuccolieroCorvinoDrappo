    \item Upon third-parties request, the system can perform parametric searches based on geographical areas, age, genre, time of the day. The result of the query is then stored and evaluated for approval.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={[}R1.\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*{]}, leftmargin=*]
        \item If the request is approved, the saved data is provided to third-party.
        \item if the request is not approved, an error message is sent to the third-party.

    \end{enumerate}
        
    \item The application allows third-parties to subscribe to certain date
    \begin{enumerate}[label={[}R1.\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*{]}, leftmargin=*]

        \item If the third-party no longer wishes to collect data from a specific user, a message is sent to him and his data is no longer sent.
    \end{enumerate}
